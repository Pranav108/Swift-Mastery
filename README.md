# Swift Mastery Repository

Welcome to my Swift Mastery Repository! ðŸš€ This repository is a comprehensive collection of Swift code that I've crafted during my journey of learning Swift programming. Below, you'll find a breakdown of the repository's contents organized into distinct categories:

## Contents:

### 1. Data Structures in Swift
Explore the fundamental building blocks of data manipulation and storage in Swift. Dive into various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more.

### 2. Threading Concepts
Learn about concurrent programming in Swift and delve into threading concepts. Understand how to manage parallel execution, threading switching, synchronization, and asynchronous operations to write efficient and responsive code.

### 3. URL Session
Discover the power of networking in Swift through the URL session framework. Explore how to make network requests, handle responses, and manage data tasks effectively.

### 4. Playground Projects
Engage with hands-on learning through various small playground projects. These projects are designed to reinforce Swift concepts and provide practical coding exercises for skill development.

## How to Use:

1. **Data Structures:**
   - Navigate to the [Data-Structures](Swift-Mastery/Data-Structures) directory to explore Swift implementations of essential data structures.
   - Each subdirectory contains code related to a specific data structure along with explanatory comments.

2. **Threading Concepts:**
   - Head to the [Threading-Concepts](Swift-Mastery/Threading-Concepts) directory to grasp the intricacies of concurrent programming in Swift.
   - Find examples and explanations regarding threading, synchronization, and asynchronous operations.

3. **URL Session:**
   - Explore the [URL-session-codecat](Swift-Mastery/URL-session-Codecat) directory to understand how to work with networking in Swift.
   - Discover code snippets and examples demonstrating the usage of URL session for making API requests.

4. **Playground Projects:**
   - Check out the [Initial-Playgrounds](Swift-Mastery/Initial-Playgrounds) directory for various small projects aimed at practical application of Swift concepts.
   - Each playground file is self-contained and designed for hands-on practice.
